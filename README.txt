To run on Athena:

Type make
Then do:
```
./a1 swp/dragonfly.swp
```

Or try any of the other swp files included.
The ones that I made are called:
- `swp/dragonfly.swp`
- `swp/tube-table.swp`

The corresponding screenshots are located in `img`

The project also works with Xcode on Mac OS. Just open `a1.xcodeproj` and run.

I didn't collaborate with anyone in the class.
Please note that I've posted my code publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/sherbondy/assignment1). I haven't explicitly shared this code with classmates, but someone may find it, in which case I hope they don't mindlessly copy my implementation.

I referred to the following works while thinking about the assignment:
- http://www.antigrain.com/research/adaptive_bezier/index.html
- The course notes


The only known issue with my code is that it doesn't seem to render
weird.swp correctly. This indicates to me that there may be a bug
in my generalized cylinder transformation function.

I haven't tried any of the extra credit problems yet.

Really enjoyed this assignment. One of the funnest PSETs I've done in 
my 2 years at MIT. Definitely helped solidify my understanding of
curves and transformations in 3D. Not overwhelming.
