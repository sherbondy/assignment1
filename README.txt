To run on athena:

Type make
Then do:
```
./a1 swp/dragonfly.swp
```

Or try any of the other swp files included.
The ones that I made are called:
- `swp/dragonfly.swp`
- `swp/tube-table.swp`

The corresponding screenshots are located in `img`

The project also works with Xcode on Mac OS. Just open a1.xcodeproj and run.
